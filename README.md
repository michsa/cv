# cv

This repo is a "living document" approach to my professional self-commodification, in which the actual content lives in markdown files that are used to generate PDFs using Github-approximate markdown rendering & styling (because it looks nice), because I feel strongly that text content should not be coupled to presentation and thus find rich text editors (ie gdocs) viscerally unpleasant to write in.

There are two documents here:

- **[cv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michsa/cv/refs/heads/master/cv.pdf)** ([source](./cv.md)) — a full record of my work history and personal projects and all that jazz, ostensibly updated whenever I do something new
- **[resume](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michsa/cv/refs/heads/master/resume.pdf)** ([source](./resume.md)) — a distillation of the above (ie the contents of the "please hire me" sign I last used to pandhandle for employment on the shoulder of the Information Superhighway), updated whenever I need a new job
